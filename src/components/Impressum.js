<h4>Liability for content </h4>
<p>
The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot 
guarantee that the content is correct, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider, 
we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to Section 7, 
Paragraph 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, 
however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored 
third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. 
Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws 
remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in 
time at which knowledge of a specific infringement of the law is known. As soon as 
we become aware of any violations of the law, we will remove this content 
immediately. 
</p>
<h4>Liability for links </h4>
<p>Our offer may contain links to external third-party websites, the content of which we 
have no influence on. Therefore we cannot assume any liability for this external 
content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for 
the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal 
violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of 
linking. However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not 
reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as we become 
aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately. </p>
<h4>copyright </h4>
<p>The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to 
German copyright law. The duplication, editing, distribution and any kind of 
exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the 
respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted 
for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created 
by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular contents 
of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a 
copyright infringement, we ask that you inform us accordingly. As soon as we 
become aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately. </p>
<h4>Data protection </h4>
<p>Our website can usually be used without providing any personal data. Insofar as 
personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our website, 
this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be 
passed on to third parties without your express consent. 
We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when 
communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the 
data against access by third parties is not possible. </p>
<h4>Changes to the Privacy Policy </h4>
<p>We reserve the right to adapt this data protection declaration so that it always corresponds to 
the current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the data protection 
declaration, e.g. when introducing new services. The new data protection declaration will then 
apply to your next visit. </p>
<h4>Contact </h4>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or the 
processing of your data, please contact us at the following email address: tinabhawal5@gmail.com
